# Database Design & Implementation Projects

This repository showcases two comprehensive database projects, demonstrating the full lifecycle from conceptual design to implementation and advanced programming.

## üìå Project Overviews

### 1. Ocean Odyssey: Relational Database Design
A complete database system designed for a global cruise booking company. The project involved analyzing business requirements and transforming them into a robust, normalized relational model.

### 2. Run Monash: Database Implementation & Programming
The implementation and extension of a database for a series of running carnivals. This project focused on writing complex SQL, enforcing business logic with server-side programming, and working with both relational and non-relational data models.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did & Learned

### Ocean Odyssey Project
*   **Conceptual Design:** Created a detailed Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) using Crow's Foot notation to visually model entities, attributes, and relationships based on business rules.
*   **Normalization:** Applied normalization principles (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to a sample data form to eliminate data redundancy and ensure logical data integrity.
*   **Logical Design & DDL:** Developed a logical model using Oracle SQL Developer Data Modeler and authored SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) scripts to generate the database schema.
*   **Key Takeaway:** Mastered the foundational process of translating real-world requirements into a sound, normalized database design.

### Run Monash Project
*   **Advanced SQL:** Wrote complex SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) scripts to query and modify data, manage transactions, and handle sequences for primary key generation.
*   **Database Programming:** Developed **PL/SQL** functions, procedures, and triggers to automate calculations and enforce critical business rules directly within the database.
*   **Schema Evolution:** Practiced **Agile Database** techniques by modifying a live database schema (adding new columns, constraints) to meet new requirements without data loss.
*   **Polyglot Persistence:** Gained experience with **NoSQL** by mapping relational data to JSON documents and performing operations in **MongoDB**, understanding the contrast between relational and non-relational models.
*   **Key Takeaway:** Gained end-to-end experience in building, populating, and maintaining a production-like database, including advanced programming and working with multiple data technologies.
